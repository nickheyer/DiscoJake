# DiscoJake
A Discord bot that brightens any server with quotes from Jake the Dog. 

Include the word "jake" in any message on your server, and DiscoJake will send a wonderful jake quote and an accompanying image. 

To set a new keyword, type "!set keyword 'Put keyword here'".
  
You can also add a quote similarly by typing "!add quote 'Put quote here'", that being said there are over a hundred quotes in the included json already. 
  
To install and run the bot, you need to create a new application via (https://discord.com/developers/applications). Once you have a TOKEN provided to you by discord, you can replace "TOKEN GOES HERE" (check the beginning of DiscoJake.py) with your token. You should be good to go!

Have any questions, contact me on discord! ~ NastyNick#4212
